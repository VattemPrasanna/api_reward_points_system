Here is a `README.md` file for the `api-reward-points-system` project, covering requirements, structure, and implementation details:

# API Reward Points System

A Spring Boot REST API that calculates customer reward points based on their transaction history, as per the requirements for a web API developer assignment.

## Problem Statement

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase:

- **2 points** for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction.
- **1 point** for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
- No points for amounts $50 or less.

**Example:**  
A $120 purchase earns: 2x$20 + 1x$50 = **90 points**.

Given a record of every transaction during a three-month period, the API calculates the reward points earned for each customer per month and in total.

## Features

- Calculates reward points per customer, per month, and total.
- No hardcoded months; uses transaction dates for grouping.
- RESTful endpoint to fetch reward points for all customers and a specific customer.
- In-memory data simulates transactions for multiple customers.
- Unit and integration tests, including negative and edge cases.
- JavaDocs at class and method levels.
- Follows Java coding standards and best practices.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build and run the Spring Boot application using Gradle:
   
./gradlew bootRun

3. Access the API endpoint:

- **GET /api/rewards**  
  Returns reward points per customer, per month, and total.


### API Endpoints
```
To Fetch all Customer Rewards:
http://www.localhost:8080/api/rewards

To Fetch specific Customer Rewards:
http://www.localhost:8080/api/rewards/{customerId}
```


- **GET /api/rewards**  
  Returns a list of customer rewards.  
  If no rewards are found, returns an error response.
  If exception occurred, returns an error response.


GET /api/rewards/{customerId}

Returns a specific customer rewards.  
If no rewards are found, returns an error response.
If exception occurred, returns an error response.

**Sample Response for success:**
```json
[
  {
    "customerId": 1,
    "monthlyPoints": {
      "2024-04": 90,
      "2024-05": 25,
      "2024-06": 250
    },
    "totalPoints": 365
  },
  "..."
]
```
**No Rewards Found:**
```json
{
   "data": null,
   "errorMessage": "Records not found for customers",
   "status": "NOT_FOUND",
   "hasError": false
}
```

**Exception Occurred (e.g., Bad Request , Internal Server Error):**
```json
{
   "data": "element cannot be mapped to a null key",
   "errorMessage": "Failed to get rewards for customers",
   "status": "400 BAD_REQUEST",
   "hasError": true
}
```

These responses should be returned by your API in the respective scenarios.
```
## Reward Calculation Logic

- For each transaction:
    - If amount > $100:  
      Points = (amount - 100) * 2 + 50
    - If $50 < amount <= $100:  
      Points = (amount - 50) * 1
    - If amount <= $50:  
      Points = 0
```
## Testing

- Unit and integration tests are included.
- Tests cover multiple customers, multiple transactions, edge cases, negative and exception scenarios.

## Coding Standards

- Follows Java best practices for naming, structure, and documentation.
- JavaDocs provided for all classes and methods.
- Code is formatted and organized as per standard conventions.

## Exclusions

- `target/`, `bin/`, and build artifacts are excluded via `.gitignore`.
- Do not upload as a zip file.
